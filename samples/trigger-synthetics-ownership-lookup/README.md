# Workflow to trigger Synthetics and Lookup Ownership Information

## Preparation
1. Ensure your synthetic scripts are tagged with a `Key:Value` pair to denote a team that owns that synthetic. For example: `SupportTeam: ABC`.
2.	Go to `Settings > Ownership > Config ([terraform can also be used](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/ownership_config))
3.	Add a key which matches your tag key. This tells DT to treat those tag values as the team ID.
4.	Go to `Settings > ownership > teams`
5.	For each tag value (eg. `ABC` define their email or other details)

Thatâ€™s it. When the workflow runs it will look up the tags on each synthetic, from there look up the relevant ownership team and then look up the email address (for example).

## Trigger the Workflow

This workflow template is triggered by an incoming cloud event with the `source == githubactions` (DT auto translates this field to `event.provider`) and `type == "com.mycompany.synthetic.batch.triggered"` (DT auto translates this to `event.type`)

```
// Requires an API token with `bizevents.ingest` permission
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://abc12345.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/bizevents/ingest \
  -d "{
        "specversion": "1.0",
        "id": "1",  // Generate a UUID here
        "source": "githubactions",
        "type": "com.mycompany.synthetic.batch.triggered",
        "data": {
            "monitors": ["HTTP_CHECK-DE1ACC402750B64F", "HTTP_CHECK-3940B2D3CC872C10"]
        }
      }"
```
## Workflow Step 1: Trigger Batch

The workflow begins by triggering a batch job for whichever `data.monitors` you want.

## Workflow Step 2: Retrieve Completion Details

When the synthetic batch has finished (remembering that inside the batch, multiple synthetics run and each of these can pass or fail independently).

## Workflow Step 3: Retrieve Synthetic Owners

Next the workflow uses the tags on each of the synthetic scripts and looks up the relevant team information.

## Workflow Step 4:  Output

The workflow template has two steps. 1 to send emails (if your tenant is enabled for this) and 1 to send an HTTPS request.
